The data will include information about each neighborhood like museums, restaurants, hotels, significant landmarks, galleries, and other tourist attractions. For NYC, I will investigate the borough of Manhattan. For Toronto, I will investigate Downtown Toronto. I will use clustering to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects. This will help locate tourist hubs and will allow me to judge the similarity or dissimilarity of the two cities.
